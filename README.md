# Crate: A Map Manager Plugin

This is an old plugin I made to manage multiple maps on a building server. This is not up to the quality I would want it so I'm not offering any archives for it. I'll rebuild this at some point with my work on the [NSAPI Project](https://github.com/NewGamesAPI-Project) as that'll include mapping features for MAPID based maps. That's not decided yet though.

Thanks for your time, archiving this lmao
